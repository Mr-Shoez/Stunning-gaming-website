## <font color="#53f8c9">🌟 About The Project</font>

This project is a recreation of a modern, dynamic gaming website landing page. It was built to practice and showcase advanced front-end development techniques, particularly focusing on creating an immersive user experience through on-scroll animations, video backgrounds, and a fully responsive layout.

The entire project was developed by following an incredibly detailed and insightful tutorial by **miladiCode**. This repository serves as my implementation of his guide, demonstrating the skills learned and the final polished product.
